# Depth First Search or DFS for a Graph
## BFS vs DFS
Note that the *BFS* code traverses only the vertices reachable from a given source vertex. 
All the vertices may not be reachable from a given vertex (example Disconnected graph). 
To print **all the vertices**, we can modify the BFS function to do traversal starting 
from all nodes one by one (Like the DFS modified version).
